Q4. Find out how many pass would be required to sort the following array in decreasing order using bubble sort
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Ans: 3 iterations are required
Original Array is {3 5 1 6 0}
In first iteration array is {5 3 6 1 0}
In second iteration array is {5 6 3 1 0}
In third iteration array is {6 5 3 1 0}

Q5. Find out the number of iterations to sort the array in descending order using selection sort.
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Ans: 3 iterations are required.
Original Array is {3 5 1 6 0}
In first iteration array is {6 5 1 3 0}
In second iteration array is {6 5 1 3 0}
In third iteration array is {6 5 3 1 0}
Now the array is sorted.
